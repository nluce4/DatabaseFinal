MeTube is a Clemson University project for CPSC 4620. The goal of the project is to create a media sharing website similar to YouTube. Users can login, view media, comment on media, favorite media, message other users, and more. The project uses javascript, HTML, PHP, and CSS to build the webpages. The database is made using MySQL.
